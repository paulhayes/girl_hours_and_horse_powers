Systemic designers tend to live and work in areas of contradiction. Visiting some of these places together with a supportive and querying group of people can produce a space to help address complex feelings and test new ideas for radical design research. I had the pleasure to present one of my projects at the 2022 ab__ Autumn Gathering, which resulted in some interesting collective observations. Ab__ is a design research network based at the House of Annetta in London <small><a href="#ref1">[16]</a></small>, a social centre and platform for practising systems change, founded by cybernetician Annetta Pedretti.

_Fantasy World_ is a 14-minute long audio piece created as part of my final MA Sustainable Design project at the University of Brighton. It is designed as a ‘sonic companion’ to be listened to during a habitual consumption activity, such as a weekly food shop. The project aims to generate a _disorienting dilemma_ through perspective transformation to change the way we learn about the world and ultimately make meaning. It invites the listener to engage in the entangled nature of the systemic objects we see on the shelves in the supermarket and reveals essential information omitted by design within institutional spaces of consumption. This omittance prevents us from seeing and feeling the effects of our everyday decisions, eliminating the vital feedback loops needed for adapting behaviour and invoking systems change.

The ‘sonic companion’ acts as a permissive feedback intervention through which we get to hear from voices that sit upstream and downstream from where we stand and act, gifting a set of new perspectives on the complex interconnectedness in which we all play a part. How may we act differently with this new knowledge?

## **THE PROJECT**

I approached this project with an awareness of both the limitations and possibilities of sound as an abstract and invisible medium and a vessel for meaning and narrative. Inspired by Linnér and Wibeck’s theory of sustainability transformation drivers <small><a href="#ref1">[7]</a></small>, I looked to juxtapose insights from diverse voices on the topic of responsible and equitable consumption, agnotology (wilful ignorance), and physical habitual activities, to develop a methodology that seeks to induce epistemic change. I hope this may provide the basis for opportunities for future research and exploration in design for systemic change towards an economics of care for people and the planet.

I took inspiration from Unknown Fields’ _We Power Our Future with the Breastmilk of Volcanoes_ <small><a href="#ref1">[3]</a></small>, Vice’s _Unfiltered History Tour_ <small><a href="#ref1">[2]</a></small> and Radiolab’s podcast episodes <small><a href="#ref1">[17]</a></small>. I also wanted to take advantage of the rise in popularity of listening to podcasts while carrying out mundane tasks such as cooking, commuting or shopping. Rather than a traditional linear narrative format commonly found in podcasts, I experimented with a looser and more playful structure. Layered voice clips and changes to the environmental sonic contexts were made to create conflicting messaging so that statements would sound as if coming from an _agnotological space,_ i.e. an environment such as a supermarket where the audience-as-customer is only privy to small bits of information about the products they are asked to purchase.

Linnér and Wibeck observe that “the importance of new stories or narratives for leveraging transformation is increasingly gaining recognition in the scholarly literature” and identify Mezirow’s theory of _perspective transformation_ as a transformative attribute, where assumptions, behaviours and paradigms are revisited <small><a href="#ref1">[7]</a></small> <small><a href="#ref1">[8]</a></small>. The four key factors that they deem necessary for causing a system to change are new narratives, transformative learning experiences, technological innovations and political economy redistribution. Transformative learning is shown to be the "most powerful driver to transcend the rigidness by which we structure the world and what is possible and desirable” and "can enable awareness to not only shift paradigms and mindsets <small><a href="#ref1">[7]</a></small>. Yet, to ultimately empower people to _transcend_ paradigms, it needs to be complemented by other factors.

Mezirow, Linnér and Wibeck suggest that perspective transformation may become the result of a _disorienting dilemma_, and when it’s confusing enough, calls for epistemic change that changes “the very form by which we make meanings” <small><a href="#ref1">[7]</a></small>. As Mathilda Tham emphasises the importance of generating _friction_ in design for enabling change to take place, I believe that these tools for disruption may be explored through design interventions <small><a href="#ref1">[12]</a></small>.

Friction as a tool for epistemic change is exemplified in Vice’s _Unfiltered History Tour_, which provides an alternative history of the British Museum’s “disputed artefacts, as told by people from their homelands” <small><a href="#ref1">[2]</a></small>. Examples of a designed _disorienting dilemma_ in Fantasy World include Zita Cobb’s quote, “we should never bring an anonymous object into our homes; if we don’t know who made it, where it came from and where the money went, it’s a kind of pollution in our lives…” <small><a href="#ref1">[15]</a></small>_._ Here, it is made to sound as if coming from a supermarket PA system, which clashes with the situated shop-floor information.

Krippendorff suggests that “designers need to question prevailing ontological beliefs” and ”explore what it takes to unfreeze cherished habits or convictions, or to get people to learn something new” <small><a href="#ref1">[6]</a></small>. According to Walker, “a habit is a behaviour that, through lots of repetition in a specific context, shifts from being triggered deliberately by your choices to being triggered automatically by the environment you're in” <small><a href="#ref1">[10]</a></small>. Habits can make us more efficient, freeing up the brain’s processing power to focus on challenging tasks rather than deciding what to have for breakfast. However, if we’re always on autopilot, we may struggle to think flexibly, broadly and creatively. Once behaviours become habits, they become increasingly difficult to change. However, Verplanken and Wood’s _habit discontinuity hypothesis_ maintains that “when context change disrupts individuals’ habits, a window opens in which behaviour is more likely to be deliberately considered” <small><a href="#ref1">[13]</a></small>.

In applying my practice of narrative sound design to design research, I wanted to explore how using this medium may go beyond awareness-raising around climate change communication and instead help facilitate systemic change. The sonic companion is composed of selected audio quotes from biologists, scholars, sustainability experts, citizens, animals, activists and corporate representatives, taken from publicly available sources.

The piece is divided into three parts where the themes of the first two are ‘The illusion of choice and true cost’ and ‘Our complex world’, and the last section promotes intrinsic value through caring calls-to-action. During the first two sections, the complexities of impact and finding solutions are highlighted, while the concluding section, ‘Caring consumption’, aims to promote intrinsic values with positive messaging, ending the piece with caring calls to action.

Western ideology has long influenced the theoretical frameworks for behavioural science, in the belief that "many of society’s most pressing problems can be addressed cheaply and effectively at the level of the individual, without modifying the system in which individuals operate”, according to Chater and Loewenstein <small><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></small>. There is a general thinking that understanding “behavioural levers” may dramatically improve “robust and effective solutions”. According to Reid and Schmidt, nudging has often been believed to be an effective “low-cost lever” for influencing citizens’ “irrational” behavioural challenges <small><a href="#ref1">[11]</a></small>. However, the questions of what the purpose is for these solutions, who benefits, and who loses out are rarely considered. The idea that “flawed individuals make poor choices” presumes that individuals may act by informed consent, which I believe isn’t possible within opaque provisioning systems. I would argue that this risks leading to individuals blaming themselves or other individuals for systemic failures rather than collectively demanding and working towards systemic change. Critics of the nudge theory point to its foundation on solutionism and in placing the responsibility of desirable change upon the individual citizen <small><a href="#ref1">[4]</a></small>, with the American advertising quote “People start pollution. People can stop it” cited as an example of this messaging.

Compared to such top-down behavioural science methods, a more holistic ontological design approach may provide a more permissive way of conceiving design for behaviour change. This approach doesn’t seek a specific solution to a problem but works from the acknowledgement that the things we design design us back. Therefore, there is a need for greater plurality and ethical considerations in the practice and theory of design.

My observations for limits and critique of the approach of this project include the general public’s (even those who identify as “caring consumers”) discomfort with engaging with systemic problems. This may be due to a lack of positive narratives around alternative ways to get our needs met outside of the norm, which is characterised by institutionalised channels of provisioning. Deviation from this ‘norm’ may carry associations with the notion of “less” and, therefore, adversity and societal exclusion. As our evaluation for thriving is measured in the level of output and amount of (material) choices we have, albeit defined within certain limited characteristics, transforming this value logic may be experienced as risky and uncomfortable. We don’t yet have positive references for how to reconcile the idea of having perhaps fewer but more transparent and equitable choices that embody a sense of security and freedom realistically and affordably. However, creating compelling encounters with diverse perspectives on complex issues, which also provides rewarding conclusions of intrinsic values, may encourage engagement and curiosity. Yet, the tendency for humans to disengage with _discomfort_ poses challenges in the pursuit of design for climate justice.

Oinonen describes values as a lens that “guides our actions and our interpretation of the world”, which is driven by emotions, not thoughts <small><a href="#ref1">[9]</a></small>. As values are based on past experiences and beliefs about the world, they are inherently subjective and hierarchical. In the context of engaging with the sounds of different voices, a listener's perception related to gender, accents, class and diction influences how they engage with or may reject, the messaging.

However, I sought to include a diverse range of sources and concluded with “caring calls to action” in the hope of attaining a wider consensus of the key arguments. According to Holmes et al., prioritising intrinsic values like connectedness with nature and equality, or creativity and freedom, tends to be linked with less prejudice and greater socio-environmental concern <small><a href="#ref1">[18]</a></small>. I am aware that simplifying complexity into evocative phrases for producing behaviour change in citizens risks perpetuating reductionist and paternalistic design thinking. In this project, I sought to “reduce unjust paternalism” in design, involving critical stakeholders in an alternative way to engage with climate change issues and come to different conclusions <small><a href="#ref1">[5]</a></small>.

## **TEST-DRIVING THE THE EXPERIENCE**

The ab__ spring gathering opened with the attendees dividing into two small groups to try out the experience; one group to listen while walking through a Sainsbury’s and one through a Tesco Express in the Spitalfields area near House of Annetta. Participants listened to the piece on Soundcloud (see link below) on their respective mobile devices through earphones. Afterwards, we all reconvened in the kitchen to share any thoughts, critiques and feelings that may have cropped up during the experience. Some comments suggested that a considerable perspective shift had taken place, while others noted a heightened awareness and discomfort of behaving anomalously within the institutionalised environment of the supermarket.

One participant noted how the physical environment changed the perception of what they were hearing, which points to the significance of these listening experiences being carried out in the intended physical environment. Another participant reported the surreal feeling of the supermarket becoming like an art gallery, where the objects on the shelves became artefacts that accompanied the audio material. Another signifier is that the built environment augmented the intended effect and an observation of how the space of the supermarket may be “recycled” into spaces for very different kinds of experiences.

However, one participant felt acutely aware of the unusual nature with which the group moved through the space, feeling paranoid about being suspected of stealing. This again highlights the normative expectations of behaviour within institutionalised spaces. Within these spaces, taking time for curiosity and learning about the systemic impacts of the products that we are expected to purchase to meet our needs is discouraged by design. Although the act of consumption with the help of technology is becoming increasingly frictionless, there are many barriers to the transparency of information in the patterns we are asked to participate in. Another participant reported the experience feeling cinematic, like the audio providing the soundtrack to the visual information, depicting a critique of the state of consumption in action. This reminded another participant to compare it to the TV programme _How Stuff Is Made_, which follows the process of making various products, showing the supply chain from material to finished object <small><a href="#ref1">[14]</a></small>. Other interesting reactions include how one participant felt that the audio encouraged them to feel repulsed by what they saw on the shelves, revealing the packages and products as a compelling “wall of branding”.

The group also agreed that the feelings resulting from the experience may change depending on one's state of mind. For example, feeling hungry would add another layer of complexity as it may compel the listener to dismiss some of the information in favour of individual present desires.

I aim for my work to highlight how we are a product of the tools and systems that were once designed for us but may no longer serve us and how we easily forget that the boundaries of our imagination are fictional while the planetary ones are not. I hope this exercise may stir ideas and thoughts for others to bring into their thinking, wording and doing, moving towards designing caring, transparent and just futures for all.
