This is a blog called Girl Hours and Horse Powers.‘Girl hours’ refers to the measure of electronic computer assembly costs used by IBM in the UK in the 1950s since the majority of the labour force were women who also earned lower hourly rates than male employees. I subvert the meaning of ‘horse powers’ from the unit of measurement of engine power to a holistic perspective of the capacities and possibilities of more-than-humans.
