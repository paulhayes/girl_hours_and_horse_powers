This is a blog called Girl Hours and Horse Powers.
‘Girl hours’ refers to the measure of computing time used by IBM in the UK in the 1950s, since the majority of the war-time computing labour force were women, who also earned lower hourly rates than male employees. At the time, the measure of computer power was in "kilo-girls", 1 kilo-girl of computing power equaling that of 1000 women <small><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></small>.  I subvert the meaning of ‘horse powers’ from the unit of measurement of engine power to a holistic perspective of the capacities and possibilities of more-than-humans.
