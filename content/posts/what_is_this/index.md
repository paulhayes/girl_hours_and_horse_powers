The blog is called Girl Hours and Horse Powers, where ‘Girl hours’ refers to the measure of electronic computer assembly costs used by IBM in the UK in the 1950’s since the majority of the labour force were women earning lower hourly rates than male employees. I subvert the meaning of ‘horse powers’ from the unit of measurement of engine power, to a holistic perspective of the capacities and possibilities of more-than-humans.
